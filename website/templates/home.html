              <h1>About Natalia</h1>
              <p>Hi, my name is Natalia Suska and you have stumbled upon my webpage. 
                I'm an undergraduate student at Georgetown University studying Operations & Analytics and Management.
                I'm also minoring in Psychology, which is pretty fun.
                At Georgetown I'm part of several clubs including: Hoyalytics, Innovo Consulting, McDonough Women, and JNET.
                At Georgetown I have been involved with Hoya Hacks, the Georgetown Startup Intern Program, and the Georgetown Scholars Program.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                I enjoy painting, drawing, and photography. My portfolios for each are on their own pages on this website. 
                I am currently accepting art commissions and photo shoots. For drawings and paintings, a commission can be directly purchased.
                For photography shoots, please contact me directly. 
              </p>
