              <p>Hi! ðŸ‘‹   
                I'm a product developer with a passion for building things based in Zurich, Switzerland. 
                I'm currently working at Deloitte in their AI & Data team.
                I also recently graduated from Georgetown University where I studied Operations & Analytics.
                As an alumni, now I get to interview high school students seeking admission to the university.
                For fun, I also love going on walks, making specialty coffee, and bees. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                I enjoy painting, drawing, and photography. My portfolios for each are on their own pages on this website. 
                For art commissions and photography shoots, please contact me directly.
