              <p>Hi! ðŸ‘‹   
                I'm a product developer based in scenic Switzerland, currently part of the AI & Data team at Deloitte. I'm a proud graduate of Georgetown University, where I delved into Operations & Analytics.
              </p>
                <br>
              <p>
                Beyond the corporate world, I am an alumni interviewer for Georgetown, chatting with local high schoolers eager to join the university. Outside of the professional realm, you'll catch me on hiking trails, crafting specialty coffee, and tending to my buzzing bee friends. 
              </p>
                <br>
              <p>
                When I'm not immersed in the tech world, I unleash my creative side through painting, drawing, and photography. Check out my portfolios for each on the tabs above. Need a custom artwork or a photoshoot? Reach out directly, and let's make some magic happen! ðŸŽ¨ðŸ“¸
