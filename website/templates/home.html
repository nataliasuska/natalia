              <p>Hi! ðŸ‘‹   
                I'm a product developer based in beautiful Switzerland, currently part of the AI & Data team at Deloitte. I'm a recent graduate of Georgetown University, where I focused in Operations & Analytics.
              </p>
                <br>
              <p>
                In my spare time, I am an alumni interviewer for Georgetown, where I get to speak with local high schoolers eager to join the university. I also enjoy hiking trails, specialty coffee, and beekeeping. 
              </p>
                <br>
              <p>
                On the weekends, I unleash my creative side through painting, drawing, and photography. Check out my portfolios for each on the tabs above. Need a custom artwork or a photoshoot? Reach out directly, and let's make some magic happen! ðŸŽ¨ðŸ“¸
