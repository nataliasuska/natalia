              <p>Hi! ðŸ‘‹   
                I'm a product developer with a passion for building things based in beautiful Switzerland. 
                I'm currently working at Deloitte, in their AI & Data team.
                I recently graduated from Georgetown University where I studied Operations & Analytics.
                As an alumni, I get to interview high school students seeking admission to the university.
                For fun, I love going on hikes, making specialty coffee, and beekeeping. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                I enjoy painting, drawing, and photography. My portfolios for each are located on their own pages, which you can navigate to at the top of this website. 
                For art commissions and photography shoots, please contact me directly.
